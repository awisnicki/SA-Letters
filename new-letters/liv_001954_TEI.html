<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span><p class="p right">I received your
<br/>letter on the <span class="">4<span class="sup underline ">th</span> of this month</span>
<br/>and was very much pleased
<br/>with it.  Your brother's did
<br/>not come so I suspect
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>it did not go to the Post
<br/>which he may take as
<br/>a hint to improve his
<br/>handwriting.  This hint I
<br/>should be glad to take to
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>myself but I fear that
<br/>my hand is incurably
<br/>bad and I trust that
<br/>you will continue to
<br/>write as fair a hand
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>as you do now and
<br/>never make your <span class="">letters</span>
<br/>as some do about as
<br/>good as if they had dipped

<br/><p class="p "><span class="add gray ">"</span>While writing to you
<br/>I am surrounded by a
<br/><span class="linenumber">5</span>number of people who
<br/>never had the means
<br/>of aquiring a knowledge
<br/>of writing or letters. They
<br/>think it a wonderful thing
<br/><span class="linenumber">10</span>that we should be able
<br/>to communicate our
<br/>thoughts to people at a

<br/>as we must do 
<br/>by <span class="">December</span> next <span class="add gray ">,</span> and
<br/>go home -  <span class="space">    </span>We went

<br/>time we were up <span class="add gray ">,</span> &amp;
<br/>left our boat hung up
<br/>on a tree <span class="add gray ">;</span> but fire
<br/>had laid hold on it,
<br/><span class="linenumber">20</span>probably from the 
<br/>grass being burned off
<br/>and we found only

<br/>were anxious to make

<br/>even <span class="">50 yards</span> off<span class="add gray ">,</span> were

<br/>A few days ago I came on a

<br/>for my rifle<span class="add gray ">;</span> but on getting
<br/><span class="linenumber">15</span>close up to them their
